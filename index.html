<div>
    <p>Bhuvneshwar Kumar, often called Bhuvi, is an Indian cricketer known for his exceptional swing bowling. Born on February 5, 1990, in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, he made headlines early in his career by dismissing Sachin Tendulkar for a duck in domestic cricket. He debuted for India in 2012, impressing with his ability to move the ball both ways. Over the years, he has been a key player in India's bowling attack, particularly in limited-overs cricket, forming a lethal partnership with Jasprit Bumrah. His mastery of line and length, combined with his clever variations, has made him a reliable bowler in crucial moments.</p>
